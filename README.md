all of my freeCodeCamp.com challenge/algorithm solutions <br>
course map: https://www.freecodecamp.org/map<br>
url to each challenge description (ie what the algorithm does) is in each .js file<br>
Disclaimer: not all of these solutions are as clean/elegant/efficient as they probably could be - I will however maybe try to post additional improved solutions
